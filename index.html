          I am a former mathematics teacher seeking an opportunity to make a
          career switch into technology. With the guidance of established web
          developers in my network, I am self-teaching current and relevant
          technologies based on their experience and recommendations. My
          ultimate goal is to find a fantastic company seeking a passionate
          employee willing to learn and contribute.
